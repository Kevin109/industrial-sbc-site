    <h1 class="masthead-title">Design Fanless, Reliable Industrial SBC Systems</h1>
    <p class="masthead-sub">
      Building a robust industrial SBC platform starts with two critical decisions: choosing the right CPU architecture and ensuring the system can operate within a sustainable thermal and power envelope. From factory automation and transportation to energy systems and remote monitoring, your hardware must remain stable in harsh environments and run 24/7 without failure.

    <h3>From Requirements to a Stable Build</h3>
    <p>
      Every industrial SBC project begins with a clear understanding of workload requirements—whether that's running a high-resolution operator interface, processing camera feeds for machine vision, or managing complex control logic. Once the performance target is set, validate software and driver support across the planned OS, estimate thermal output under full load, and ensure your BOM aligns with component availability for the entire product lifecycle. Only then should you lock in the board, I/O configuration, and display interface to ensure a stable and supportable system.
