Intel Embedded SKUs are targeted for long-life availability and rugged operating ranges. Typical
deployments include medical consoles, industrial gateways, test equipment, and retail systems.

Topics include platform selection, graphics and display pipelines, PCIe expansion, and security
features such as secure boot and attestation. We discuss BSP upkeep, driver pinning, and
validation to avoid regressions throughout a productâ€™s lifetime.
