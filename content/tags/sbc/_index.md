Single-board computers condense a complete computer onto a palm-sized PCB. This tag provides a
broad survey—from entry-level boards to rugged industrial units—so you can map requirements to the
right class of hardware.

We compare I/O, storage, display options, and OS support; discuss bring-up and BSP maintenance;
and outline paths to secure, updateable systems. You’ll also find advice on benchmarking
meaningful to embedded use, not just synthetic scores.

Start here if you’re sketching an architecture and want a clear view of trade-offs before you
commit.
