Understanding and controlling power consumption is essential for reliable embedded products. Here
we present measurement techniques (bench supplies, inline monitors), profiling methods, and
repeatable test scenarios that reveal true energy costs of workloads.

Guides connect power numbers to thermal and acoustic outcomes, explain governor impacts, and show
how to set limits without unexpected throttling. We also discuss designing for brownouts, surges,
and safe recovery.

Armed with real data, teams can right-size heatsinks, enclosures, and power budgets for long
service life.
