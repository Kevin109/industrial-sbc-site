An ARM SoC integrates CPU cores, graphics, multimedia blocks, memory controllers, and I/O into a
compact die, delivering excellent performance-per-watt. This tag explains the architectural
building blocks—big.LITTLE clusters, cache hierarchies, ISP/codec engines, and NPUs—and how they
influence real-world behavior.

We demystify datasheets and marketing terms, mapping them to measurable outcomes like frame
latency, boot time, and sustained throughput under thermal limits. Articles also cover secure
boot, trusted execution, and lifecycle firmware management essential for products in the field.
