Edge AI refers to running ML inference close to where data is generated. Compared with cloud-only
designs, it reduces latency, saves bandwidth, and keeps sensitive data on-site. This tag
aggregates patterns for choosing models, selecting accelerators, and instrumenting systems for
observability.

Topics include quantization (INT8/FP16), batching strategies for real-time streams, camera and
sensor pipelines, and mixed-precision math on CPUs/GPUs/NPUs. We also discuss fail-open vs. fail-
safe behavior, update channels for models, and auditability for regulated industries.

Practical, measurement-driven posts help teams reach deterministic performance within tight power
envelopes.
