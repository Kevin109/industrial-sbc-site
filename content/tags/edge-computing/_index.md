Edge computing pushes data processing from centralized clouds to on-premise nodes—SBCs, gateways,
and smart endpoints. The result is lower latency and better resilience when networks are
intermittent.

Articles in this tag cover node sizing, storage and caching strategies, secure remote management,
and how to distribute workloads across edge and cloud tiers. We examine container orchestration on
constrained devices, observability stacks that actually fit, and rollback-ready deployment
pipelines.

Use these guides to design an edge footprint that stays maintainable as fleets scale from dozens
to thousands.
