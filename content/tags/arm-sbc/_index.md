ARM-based single-board computers are the backbone of modern embedded products, prized for low
power draw, high integration, and rich I/O. This tag covers SoCs from multiple vendors, board form
factors, and the software stacks that keep products maintainable for years.

We explain boot flows, device trees, kernel choices, and BSP maintenance; compare CSI/MIPI/PCIe
connectivity; and show how to tune governors and DVFS for stable real-time behavior. Power
budgeting, battery operation, and thermals for fanless designs are treated with measured data, not
guesses.

Readers will also find guidance on containerizing services, OTA update strategies, and how to run
ML inference efficiently on ARM CPUs, NPUs, and integrated GPUs.
