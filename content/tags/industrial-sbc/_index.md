Industrial SBCs provide dependable compute for automation, robotics, medical devices, and
kiosks—often with fanless operation and multi-year availability. Compared with hobby boards, they
offer stronger power delivery, more resilient storage options, and better thermal behavior in
sealed boxes.

This tag curates articles on choosing between ARM and x86, budgeting power for 24/7 use, and
managing OS/BSPs across lifecycles. We present measured results for workloads common to the field:
HMIs, protocol translation, vision at the edge, and lightweight analytics.

You’ll find templates for bills of materials, enclosure and airflow decisions, and checklists that
reduce risk from prototype to pilot to mass deployment.
