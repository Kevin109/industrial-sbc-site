Intel platforms remain a staple of embedded and industrial computing thanks to wide software
compatibility and mature toolchains. This tag surveys CPUs from efficient parts to high-core-count
options, with attention to integrated graphics and media blocks useful for HMIs and encode/decode
pipelines.

We review I/O, virtualization, TSN/real-time features, and thermal behavior in compact fanless
systems. Articles also note lifecycle and supply considerations important for multi-year products.

If you need predictable performance and broad OS support, these posts help frame a balanced Intel-
based design.
