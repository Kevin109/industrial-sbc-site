Industrial computing focuses on computers that survive long duty cycles in harsh conditions.
Beyond raw performance, the priorities are lifecycle, maintainability, and safety.

Guides here outline enclosure and connector choices, EMC/EMI mitigation, power integrity, OS
hardening, and update strategies that respect production windows. We compare components with
extended temperature ratings and cover documentation practices that streamline compliance and
field service.

If you build equipment that must run for years, this tag brings together the decision points that
matter.
