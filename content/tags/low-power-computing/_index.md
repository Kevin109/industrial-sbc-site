Low-power computing is about doing more work per joule. For embedded devices, that means smarter
silicon choices and meticulous system design. This tag covers DVFS tuning, sleep states,
peripheral gating, and firmware strategies that eliminate wasted wake-ups.

We show how to measure real energy per task, translate workloads into thermal budgets, and size
batteries or PSUs accordingly. Examples include fanless HMIs, gateways on limited power, and
portable instruments that must run for days.

The end goal: predictable battery life and cool enclosures without crippling performance.
