Embedded systems combine computing, sensors, and actuators to perform dedicated tasks—often under
strict power and timing limits. This tag takes a system view: hardware selection, OS and
middleware choices, real-time behavior, and lifecycle maintenance.

We cover graphics stacks for HMIs, field-updatable firmware, partitioning safety-critical from
non-critical code, and designing for observability and remote diagnostics. Reference checklists
help teams converge on reliable, serviceable products.

The emphasis is on shipping: architecture patterns that reduce surprises when units leave the lab.
