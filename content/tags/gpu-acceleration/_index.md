GPUs and integrated graphics unlock massive parallelism for vision, analytics, and UI rendering.
This tag covers when GPU acceleration pays off on embedded boards, and how to size memory
bandwidth and power delivery to avoid bottlenecks.

We discuss compute APIs, zero-copy pipelines from cameras to shaders, and how to profile kernels
to reach deterministic latencies. Examples show hybrid CPU/GPU/NPU pipelines and fallback behavior
when thermals clamp frequencies.

Useful for teams moving beyond CPU-only designs but who still need predictable real-time
performance.
