Edge AI brings trained models out of the data center and into the field—running directly on
single-board computers, smart sensors, kiosks, and industrial HMIs. This tag documents practical
techniques for deploying neural networks under strict power and thermal budgets, where every watt
and millisecond matter.

You’ll find guides on model selection (CNNs, transformers, tinyML), quantization and pruning to
fit RAM/flash limits, and acceleration options available on modern SBCs: CPUs with vector
extensions, integrated GPUs, NPUs, and heterogeneous pipelines. We also cover dataset curation for
edge scenarios, streaming inference, offline fallback, and privacy-by-design architectures that
keep sensitive data local.

Whether you are building quality inspection on a factory line, people counting in retail, or
anomaly detection in utilities, the articles consolidate design patterns, real measurements, and
troubleshooting tips so teams can move from proof-of-concept to reliable 24/7 deployment.
