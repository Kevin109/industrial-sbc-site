Fanless designs rely on passive cooling, meaning every extra watt of heat generated must be dissipated through heatsinks and chassis design without the help of active airflow. This makes &lt;strong>CPU architecture choice—x86 or ARM—especially important&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In industrial environments, where 24/7 operation, reliability, and environmental constraints matter, the power efficiency of the SBC determines not only thermal stability but also &lt;strong>longevity, maintenance requirements, and operating costs&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
