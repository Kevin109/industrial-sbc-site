The choice between &lt;strong>ARM&lt;/strong> and &lt;strong>x86&lt;/strong> is not just about processor speed—it affects everything from thermal design and power budgets to software development, maintenance, and long-term supply. In industrial environments, where products may need to operate continuously for a decade or more, the architecture you choose will directly influence system reliability, development costs, and your ability to adapt to future requirements.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
