Both companies have decades of experience in CPU design, mature product lines tailored for embedded computing, and long-term supply commitments. But while they share the x86 instruction set and many architectural similarities, their embedded product offerings differ significantly in &lt;strong>performance characteristics, power efficiency, cost structure, and ecosystem support&lt;/strong>. These differences have practical implications for developers building industrial PCs, single-board computers (SBCs), and edge AI systems.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
