Whether it’s a remote IoT sensor hub, a battery-powered control unit, or a fanless human-machine interface (HMI), many industrial deployments must operate reliably for years while consuming minimal energy. In these scenarios, &lt;strong>ARM-based System-on-Chips (SoCs)&lt;/strong> have emerged as the dominant choice—outcompeting x86 and other architectures in both cost efficiency and performance-per-watt.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This article explores the &lt;strong>technical and practical reasons behind ARM SoCs’ dominance&lt;/strong> in low-power industrial applications, from their architectural advantages to ecosystem maturity and real-world deployment benefits.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
